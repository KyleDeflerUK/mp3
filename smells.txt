Smells Questions
MP3

1. The code smell is duplicated code. The code from line 558 is repeated in line 606. This can be fixed by removing the repeated code and running it via a method instead.

3. The updateAndTrim has "Feature Envy" and fits better within the jenkins.model.Jenkins class. It should be moved to there.

4. The code from likes 249-254 are repeating and iterating on something. This is a duplicated code smell. These would be best replaced with a for loop.

6. The code in file LazyBuildMixInTest.java from lines 45 through line 61 are repeated exactly on line 68. This is Duplicate Code, and should be fixed by making a method out of it.
